# AORs (abundance-occupancy relationships)
A repository for a meta-analysis of abundance-occupancy relationships

## Notes
Data files that were too big to fit in this repository can be downloaded from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/r5wwjsz42etb0r17iw77v/h?rlkey=pa8l7iw367c40iiygrrvon80h&dl=0). Also, we use the R package, `asreml`, which needs to be bought from [here](https://vsni.co.uk/software/asreml-r) if all the analyses need to be replicated. However, we have provided Rds files, which have meta-analytic model results so people can check these model outputs. All other analyses apart from meta-analyses should be replicated.
